<h1> React-Redux-Calendar </h1>

*<h3>a small application that stores meeting information using state :blue_book:</h3>*

>from the series: practicing REACT, REDUX and API   :muscle:

----- 

The functionality of the task was based on the following:

* the user completes the form
* form validation exists
* data is saved in local API
* the data is also displayed in the panel

<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

:heavy_check_mark: In this task, I learned the basics of [REDUX](https://redux.js.org/)


:heavy_check_mark: [Redux Fundamentals](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow) - action, store, dispatch

:heavy_check_mark: How to divide a task into several modules (so that the code is more readable and that one module does not have several functions)

:heavy_check_mark: what is [reducer](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)

:heavy_check_mark: what is [dispatch](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow)

:heavy_check_mark: how to connect: Extracting Data with [mapStateToProps](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate)

:heavy_check_mark: how to connect: Dispatching Actions with [mapDispatchToProps](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch)

:heavy_check_mark: I practised [Component State](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-does-setstate-do) and [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) in React

:heavy_check_mark: how to work with local api and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes:  :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* you must enter the appropriate folder (command "cd" + file name, e.g. cd excursionfile)
* you must to install all packages via  *npm install*
* then you can start *npm start*



JSON SERVER

is installed in the project so you have to run it as well, otherwise the API will not work.
go to the root directory and type

----

**npx json-server --watch ./db/data.json --port 3005**


From now on, the API will be available at: http://localhost:3005/meetings,
